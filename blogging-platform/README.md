# Personal Blogging Plattform

This app, might be a bit of a stretch - but I intend to create a fullstack application that has an administrative frontend for writing blogposts, and expose an API where these can be consumed from clients.

This project was inspired by creating a Personal Blogging Platform API, but I took it a bit further and added an administrative frontend for it aswell.

## Intentions

- I want to get used to how to structure a go-project, I will take inspiration from [golang-standards/project-layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout)
- I want to get used to the built in http library that comes with golang, so I will not use Fiber, echo, beego or anything like this.
