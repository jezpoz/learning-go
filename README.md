# Learning go

This repository is a collection of small-ish applications that I've made to get to know golang.

I take inspiration from [roadmap.sh backend project ideas](https://roadmap.sh/backend/project-ideas)

## Overview

1. A personal blogging plattform API

In this project I will create an fullstack blogging platform, where I can create posts and publish them. To then be consumed by other headless frontends.
